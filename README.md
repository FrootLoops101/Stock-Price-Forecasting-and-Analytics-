## Project Description

StockSense provides an end-to-end analytics platform for stock market forecasting. It uses realistic market data simulations or live data with extensive preprocessing and computes over 25 technical indicators including MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and more. It performs comprehensive risk analysis (Value at Risk, Maximum Drawdown, Sharpe Ratio), and uses ensemble machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression) for accurate price forecasting.

Designed with production-readiness in mind, StockSense features robust error handling, a modular object-oriented codebase, and professional visualization dashboards illustrating detailed technical analysis, portfolio risk-return profiles, ML prediction accuracy, and feature importance for transparency.

## Features

- **Advanced Technical Indicators**  
  25+ indicators: SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, Williams %R, ATR, and more.

- **Comprehensive Risk Metrics**  
  18+ metrics including Value at Risk (VaR 95%, 99%), Maximum Drawdown, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Return Distribution analysis.

- **Machine Learning Ensemble Forecasting**  
  Combines Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge, and Linear Regression models with optimized ensembles and time series-aware validation.

- **Rich Visualizations and Dashboards**  
  Multi-panel professional charts for technical analysis, risk-return scatter plots, cumulative return comparisons, prediction confidence intervals, feature importance, and portfolio summaries.

- **Production-Quality Architecture**  
  Robust error handling, modular design, scalable for multiple stocks, and clear, maintainable code.

- **Configurable Time Frames and Stocks**  
  Easily adjust analyzed stocks and data periods.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StockSense.git
   cd StockSense
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main forecasting system with visual outputs:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_stock_forecaster.py
   ```

***

## Usage

Simply run the main script to generate complete technical analysis, risk metrics, machine learning forecasts, and portfolio dashboards.

The system will simulate or load stock data (TSLA, AAPL, MSFT by default), calculate indicators, train ML models, and display multiple interactive charts for comprehensive insights.

Customize the `symbols` list and date ranges within the script for different assets or periods.
